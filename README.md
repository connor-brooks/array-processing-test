#Array Processing Test

##Instructions
See ProgrammingTestSpecV2.html

##How to run
* Either run `./tests.sh` or manually compile with `make`
* run `./list_adder iterations [values...]` where `iterations` is the number of times the process should repeat, and `value` is a list of space seperated intergers the process should perform on.

##Notes
* `main.c` is heavily commented, a non-commented version has been provided for the sake of realiablity in `main.nocmments.c`
* An automated testing utility has been provided, which runs through all the tests listed in `ProgrammingTestSpecV2.html`
